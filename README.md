## Overview

It was a simple project, but I'm convinced that starting with the fundamentals and building from there is crucial.

## My process

First, I analized the UI and thought how to approach the solution. After that, I came up with a simple way to make the qr card and I styled it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned how to use the minimun height of all the screen, a true understanding on how to position things and the ch unit. Along the way, I've started to improve my naming comvention with BEM and custom CSS properties.

### Continued development

From now on, I'll learn on how to make layouts that are not fixed values and name my elements in a clear and specific way. After mastering the basics of CSS, I'll incorporate into my solutions SASS and React.
